Sidekiq extension to track job execution statuses and returning job results back to the client in a convenient manner

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq_status'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Basic

Create a status-friendly worker by include SidekiqStatus::Worker module having #perform method with Sidekiq worker-compatible signature:

```ruby
class MyWorker
   include SidekiqStatus::Worker

   def perform(arg1, arg2)
      # do something
   end
end
```

Now you can enqueue some jobs for this worker

```ruby
jid = MyWorker.perform_async('val_for_arg1', 'val_for_arg2')
```

If a job is rejected by some Client middleware, #perform_async returns false (as it does with ordinary Sidekiq worker).

Now, you can easily track the status of the job execution:

```ruby
status_container = SidekiqStatus::Container.load(jid)
status_container.status # => 'waiting'
```

When a jobs is scheduled its status is *waiting*. As soon sidekiq worker begins job execution its status is changed to *working*.
If the job successfully finishes (i.e. doesn't raise an unhandled exception) its status is *complete*. Otherwise its status is *failed*.

### Communication from Worker to Client

*SidekiqStatus::Container* has some attributes and *SidekiqStatus::Worker* module extends your Worker class with a few methods which allow Worker to leave
some info for the subsequent fetch by a Client. For example you can notify client of the worker progress via *at* and *total=* methods

```ruby
class MyWorker
   include SidekiqStatus::Worker

   def perform(arg1, arg2)
      objects = Array.new(200) { 'some_object_to_process' }
      self.total= objects.count
      objects.each_with_index do |object, index|
        at(index, "Processing object #{index}")
        object.process!
      end
   end
end
```

Lets presume a client refreshes container at the middle of job execution (when it's processing the object number 50):

```ruby
container = SidekiqStatus::Container.load(jid) # or container.reload

container.status       # => 'working'
container.at           # => 50
container.total        # => 200
container.pct_complete # => 25
container.message      # => 'Processing object #{50}'
```

Also, a job can leave for the client any custom payload. The only requirement is json-serializeability

```ruby
class MyWorker
   include SidekiqStatus::Worker

   def perform(arg1, arg2)
      objects = Array.new(5) { |i| i }
      self.total= objects.count
      result = objects.inject([]) do |accum, object|
        accum << "result #{object}"
        accum
      end

      self.payload= result
   end
end
```


Then a client can fetch the result payload

```ruby
container = SidekiqStatus::Container.load(jid)
container.status  # => 'complete'
container.payload # => ["result 0", "result 1", "result 2", "result 3", "result 4"]
```

SidekiqStatus stores all container attributes in a separate redis key until it's explicitly deleted via container.delete method
or until redis key expires (see SidekiqStatus::Container.ttl class_attribute).

### Job kill

Any job which is waiting or working can be killed. A working job is killed at the moment of container access.

```ruby
container = SidekiqStatus::Container.load(jid)
container.status # => 'working'
container.killable? # => true
container.should_kill # => false

container.request_kill

container.status # => 'working'
container.killable? # => false
container.should_kill # => true

sleep(1)

container.reload
container.status # => 'killed'
```

### Sidekiq web integration

SidekiqStatus also provides an extension to Sidekiq web interface with /statuses page where you can track and kill jobs
and clean status containers.

   1. Setup Sidekiq web interface according to Sidekiq documentation
   2. Add "require 'sidekiq_status/web'" beneath "require 'sidekiq/web'"
